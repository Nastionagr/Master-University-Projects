Number each step.\n* Properly comment all your steps. Comments are evaluated for 2 points of the total together with the final presentation of the solution. However, it is not desirable to write novels! \n* Do not leave the task to the last minute.\n* Hand in a notebook that has already been run (i.e. do not delete outputs before handing in).\n\n## What are you supposed to do:\n\n  1. Download the dataset [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/aq08ytozfplb97b/data.csv?dl=0).\n  1. Use 2 binning methods (on features of your choice, with your choice of parameters) and comment on its effects on classification performance. _(3 points)_\n  1. Use at least 2 other data balancing techniques of your choice on the dataset and comment the classification results. **Just copied code from tutorial 4 will not be accepted.** _(6 points)_\n  1. Run all classification tests at least three times - once for unbalanced original data, twice for balanced data (try at least 2 balancing techniques), compare those results and discuss (give a comment). _(5 points)_\n  \nAll your steps and following code **have to be commented!** Comments are evaluated for _2 points_ together with the final presentation of the solution.\n\n**If you do all this properly, you will obtain 16 points.**\n\n## Comments\n\n  * Please follow the technical instructions from https://courses.fit.cvut.cz/NI-PDD/homeworks/index.html.\n  * If the reviewing teacher is not satisfied, she can (!) give you another chance to rework your homework and to obtain more points. However, this is not a given, so do your best! :)\n  * English is not compulsory.\n  \n## Data description\n\n* The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/aq08ytozfplb97b/data.csv?dl=0).\n* The data are devoted to the binary classification task, the aim is to predict the probability that a driver will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year.\n* Target feature is called 'y' and signifies whether or not a claim was filed for that policy holder.\n* To fulfill the task one does not need to know the meaning of predictors.\n* Predictors that belong to similar groupings are tagged as such in the feature names (e.g., ind, reg, car, calc). In addition, feature names include the postfix bin to indicate binary features and cat to indicate categorical features. Features without these designations are either continuous or ordinal. Values of -1 indicate that the feature was missing from the observation.\n* While using [train_test_split](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html), control the shuffling of data by random_state parameter. Do not use shuffle=False, probably never (can cause systematic error).","metadata":{"cell_id":"5bfa35524172495b97e9468b199f5a4b","deepnote_cell_height":2261,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"### here comes your code\n\n\n\n\n\n","metadata":{"cell_id":"acc3be25edb6410e9f3bdb861f1c51b1","source_hash":"8db2ee1d","execution_start":1662743409241,"execution_millis":44,"deepnote_cell_height":184,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a style='text-decoration:none;line-height:16px;display:flex;color:#5B5B62;padding:10px;justify-content:end;' href='https://deepnote.com?utm_source=created-in-deepnote-cell&projectId=6f8757f7-ae28-4cc9-959f-a95a2ed810b1' target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt='Created in deepnote.com' style='display:inline;max-height:16px;margin:0px;margin-right:7.5px;' src='data:image/svg+xml;base64,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' > </img>\nCreated in <span style='font-weight:600;margin-left:4px;'>Deepnote</span></a>","metadata":{"tags":[],"created_in_deepnote_cell":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0,"metadata":{"deepnote":{},"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","language":"python","display_name":"Python 3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.9.2","mimetype":"text/x-python","file_extension":".py","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"nbconvert_exporter":"python"},"deepnote_notebook_id":"d2feccbc216340dcbbd4eb6f3552a036","deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
