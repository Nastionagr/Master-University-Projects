Number each step.\n* Most steps contain the number of features that should be treated. You can preprocess more features, however, it does not mean that the teacher will give you more points. Focus on quality, not quantity.\n* Properly comment all your steps. Comments are evaluated for 2 points of the total together with the final presentation of the solution. However, it is not desirable to write novels! \n* This task is the most challenging of the three, both timewise and computationally. Do not leave it to the last minute.\n* Hand in a notebook that has already been run (i.e. do not delete outputs before handing in).\n\n## What are you supposed to do:\n\n  1. Download the dataset MetObjects.csv from the repository https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess/.\n  2. Check consistency (i.e. that same things are represented in the same way) of at least **three features** where you expect problems (include \"Object Name\" feature). You can propose how to clean the selected features, however do not apply cleaning (in your interest) ðŸ™‚ _(1.5 points)_\n  3. Select at least **two features** where you expect integrity problems (describe your choice) and check integrity of those features. By integrity we mean correct logical relations between features (e.g. female names for females only). _(2 points)_\n  4. Convert at least **five features** to a proper data type. Choose at least one numeric, one categorical and one datetime. _(1.5 points)_\n  5. Find some outliers and describe your method. _(3 points, depends on creativity)_\n  6. Detect missing data in at least **three features**, convert them to a proper representation (if they are already not), and impute missing values in at least **one feature**. _(1 + 3 points, depends on creativity)_\n  7. Focus more precisely on the cleaning of the \"Medium\" feature. As if you were to use it in KNN algorithm later. _(2 points)_\n  8. Focus on the extraction of physical dimensions of each item (width, depth and height in centimeters) from the \"Dimensions\" feature. _(2 points)_\n  \nAll your steps and following code **have to be commented!** Comments are evaluated for 2 points together with the final presentation of the solution.\n\n**If you do all this properly, you will obtain 18 points.**\n\n## Comments\n\n  * Please follow the technical instructions from https://courses.fit.cvut.cz/NI-PDD/homeworks/index.html.\n  * If the reviewing teacher is not satisfied, she can (!) give you another chance to rework your homework and to obtain more points. However, this is not a given, so do your best! :)","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"260ab249593a43b7b6e55bb0fef946b3","deepnote_cell_height":2002,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"### your code goes here","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"ed43ace9ad2e47459bd752a214ada334","source_hash":"9e2da255","execution_start":1662743365252,"execution_millis":43,"deepnote_cell_height":76,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a style='text-decoration:none;line-height:16px;display:flex;color:#5B5B62;padding:10px;justify-content:end;' href='https://deepnote.com?utm_source=created-in-deepnote-cell&projectId=614b115f-4826-4671-88e5-e1bb9703484b' target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt='Created in deepnote.com' style='display:inline;max-height:16px;margin:0px;margin-right:7.5px;' src='data:image/svg+xml;base64,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' > </img>\nCreated in <span style='font-weight:600;margin-left:4px;'>Deepnote</span></a>","metadata":{"tags":[],"created_in_deepnote_cell":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0,"metadata":{"deepnote":{"is_reactive":false},"orig_nbformat":2,"deepnote_notebook_id":"9073ededba0643989fa17f1a82f4f1be","deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
